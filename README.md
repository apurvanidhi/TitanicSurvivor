# Titanic Survivor Prediction using Python
Using the Titanic dataset available on Kaggle, the survival rate of passengers on titanic are analysed following some preprocessing and Logistic regression is also used.
# Data Overview
The data has been split into two groups: training set (train.csv) test set (test.csv)

The training set should be used to build our machine learning models. The test set should be used to see how well our model performs on unseen data.
# What to Predict?
For each passenger in the test set,Our model will be trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.
